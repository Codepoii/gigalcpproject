### The great march to 5MB LCP for Lancer

The Giga LCP Project is a test in futility. It is an absurdist goal to spite chromium browser users who can't adjust their cache. The objective is simple: Produce a 5MB giga-LCP that causes legitimate strain on comp/con.

It is meant to feature everything except bonds, which are simply too difficult to produce en masse at the scales needed to achieve the 5MB goal.

There is a specific standard which the LCP is typed to. A compact form focused on readability, limiting the bloated visual size typically associated with LCP data due to the ubiquity of the LCP editor and it's extremely loose standard. It should show itself to be slightly easier to diagnose as more data is presented in a more succinct and presentable format. It will end up being slightly more difficult to diagnose if an issue arises, but following the template provided at the top of each json should reduce risk of error.



# Balance of the Project
### A futile effort

Balance in the Giga LCP Project is secondary to the effort of producing as much data as possible. There may be repeat ideas or statlines, though the rough LANCER balance will be loosely followed for the sake of usability.

Important consessions include a lack of image data; a repetition of mech, system, and weapon concepts; a notable lack of space efficiency; a lack of true balance; and an overlap of interacting pieces that may throw balance out of wack.
